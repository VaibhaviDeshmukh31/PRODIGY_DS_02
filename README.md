## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Titanic Dataset

This task was completed as part of my Data Science internship at Prodigy Infotech using Google Colab. The goal was to perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of choice. I selected the well-known **Titanic dataset** from Kaggle for this analysis.

 Objective:
To explore the Titanic dataset, clean the data, analyze relationships between variables, and identify trends and patterns to gain insights.

### ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries Used:
- Google Colab
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

 Key Steps Performed:
- Imported and examined the Titanic dataset
- Handled missing values (e.g., Age, Embarked)
- Converted categorical variables to numeric (e.g., Sex, Embarked)
- Analyzed relationships between features (e.g., Age vs Survival, Gender vs Survival)
- Created visualizations like:
  - Count plots
  - Histograms
  - Heatmaps (for correlation)
- Drew insights from data patterns (e.g., survival rates by gender and class)

 Outcome:
Successfully performed EDA and discovered key survival trends in the Titanic dataset. This task enhanced my skills in data preprocessing, visualization, and deriving insights from real-world datasets using Python in a cloud-based environment (Colab).
